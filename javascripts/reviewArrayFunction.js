It helps me to easily organize my thoughts with labels and study pads. The best Bible app for mobile and tablets, bar none!", // no need to have html there even.

Though this app isn't perfect, it accomplishes its various functions very well. Thank you!",

I will recommend this app for anyone that is serious about reading and studying the Word of God. My gratitude goes to each and everyone that contributes to this project. If there was a way to pay for translations that is not available due to copyright restrictions, then this would be the ultimate Bible app.",

    "Multiple workspaces are nice when I'm following a study plan with passages for both New testament and Old testament - and a separate workspace for just jumping to various books & verses. I like to split the window in parts so I can look to a meaning of Greek word from dictionary or keep my personal notes open. Bookmarks and notes are also private, not always shared with friends. I like to keep focus on the Word of God and I think this app is better focused on the Word than some other Bible apps.",
    "Best study Bible I have used",
    "Thank you very much for your work! It is really very convenient to study the Bible.",
    "My favorite thing about the 4.0 update is that, when you enter a note, the note field unobtrusively pops up above the keyboard. Often in apps, calling up the keyboard gives a text field above it that covers the rest of the screen, or worse the keyboard covers the field one is entering text into.",
    'Probably the most comprehensive free Bible program for Android. The only "shortcoming" is the lack of commercial Bible editions (such as Luther Bible, NG√ú, etc.). However, this is not due to the program, but to the Bible societies, which do not license their translations for this program (or others).',
    "Been using this app for years. It took some time to understand how to navigate but now I've got it! I got 4.0 on my phone but screen real estate is so limited I can't use all the new features. Will be glad when the tablet update is out. It's not a problem with the app. It's just that the phone is small and my fingers are big.",
